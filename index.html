<p><h4>What is this document? Why are we collecting these data?</h4>
AICCU is required by state law to collect and submit the aggregated, unduplicated number of Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT) students admitted to the independent segment to the Governor and Legislature.</p>

<p>This document provides guidelines and materials for the 2020 ADT collection and <u><i>will be updated with additional notes as needed</i></u>. As such, if you are responsible for submitting the survey, please consider bookmarking this page.</p>

<div id="FAQ"><h3>FAQ</h3></div></p>

<p><details>
    <summary>We never signed an MOU with the Community Colleges - do we still need to submit data?</summary>
  <font color="#0063a6">Yes. AICCU is required by state law to collect and submit the aggregated, unduplicated number of Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT) students admitted to the independent segment to the Governor and Legislature. This is regardless of if the MOU with the Community Colleges was signed. </font></details>
    <br>
<details>
    <summary>Should I just send ADT student records that have enrolled?</summary>
  <font color="#0063a6">No! As part of statute, we are reporting all ADT students that were admitted to AICCU institutions, not necessarily enrolled. Please send all ADT students that applied and were accepted to your institution to begin during the fall 2019 period. </font>
  </details>
 <br>
  <details>
    <summary>Are you requesting data for all ADT students admitted to our institution or only those ADT students who are pursuing the same major with the 60-unit guarantee?</summary>
  <font color="#0063a6">All. We are requesting all records of ADT students that were admitted to your institution during this period, regardless of their expressed major at your institution. This is because the current statute requests that AICCU reports the unduplicated number of admitted ADT students in the sector. </font>
  </details>
   <br>
  <details>
    <summary>I don&rsquo;t have access to my OneDrive folder. How do I get it?</summary>
  <font color="#0063a6">You should have recently received access to the OneDrive folder, as well as a link in your initial e-mail. If you have not, please contact randy.tarnowski@aiccu.edu</font>
  </details>
  <br>
  <details>
    <summary>How do I decide which records to include?</summary>
    <font color="#0063a6"><b>The short version:</b> refer again to the qualifications table below: <br><img src="qualifications.png"><br>
    <b>The longer version:</b> there are two criteria that must be met to qualify as an admitted/accepted ADT student:
    Should have been admitted/accepted to your institution to begin in the fall 2019 period: Note that this is not contingent on whether they enrolled or not.
    Should have identified/been identified as ADT: For the purposes of this collection, we are counting all students who identify as part of the ADT program at any point in the admission process. This could be through your institution’s application (e.g., a checkbox that allowed the student to self-identify as ADT) or through a review of the student’s transcript (did it contain an AA-T or AS-T?). We have learned that neither of these methods are perfect given that CC transcripts can be inconsistent in notating the AA-T/AS-T. This does not mean that they must be pursuing the same major as their ADT degree: We are requesting all ADT students that were admitted to your institution during this period, regardless of their expressed major at your institution. This is because the current statute requests that AICCU reports the unduplicated number of admitted ADT students in the sector.
    </font>
    </details>
   <br>
  <details>
    <summary>How does AICCU define an admitted student? What is the difference between admitted and accepted?</summary>
  <font color="#0063a6">AICCU considers these terms as interchangeable: that is, a student is admitted/accepted to your institution if they have been formally offered a seat at any point. We understand that terminology differs from institution to institution. If the student has been offered a space and is flagged as an ADT, please submit their record.
  </font>
  </details>
    <br>
   <details>
    <summary>How do I encrypt/protect my file? Can I send it by e-mail?</summary>
  <font color="#0063a6">No. Please DO NOT send any files via e-mail. Once records are entered into the Excel file, use the “protect workbook” feature of Excel to create a password. Instructions on how to protect an Excel workbook can be found here (<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/protect-an-excel-file-7359d4ae-7213-4ac2-b058-f75e9311b599">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/protect-an-excel-file-7359d4ae-7213-4ac2-b058-f75e9311b599</a>). Once you upload the encrypted Excel file, enter your password in the Exit survey or e-mail it to me.  </font></details>
    <br>
   <details>
    <summary>Who does AICCU want to be in charge of this process at my institution?</summary>
  <font color="#0063a6">We understand that the ADT collection process is a collaborative effort between multiple departments (Registrar, Financial Aid, Institutional Research, IT, Enrollment) and that this may differ from institution to institution. As such, we defer to your institutions on how to capture these records. We apologize for inconvenience if there are too many people included in the initial e-mails, but given turnover and bouncebacks, we have found this is often the best way given the size and scope of this important project.
  </font>
  </details>
  <br>
    <details>
    <summary>Can’t AICCU pull ADT records from the community colleges?</summary>
  <font color="#0063a6">Unfortunately, not. We understand that this would be less time consuming to institutions; however, the community colleges currently do not have unified access to ADT transfers.
    </font>
    </details>
    <br><br />
     <details>
    <summary>I have not been able to access the OneDrive folder - the landing page asks me to enter my email and an access code will be sent. I don’t receive the code. What&rsquo;s the problem?</summary>
  <font color="#0063a6">We have confirmed that for some schools, this is an with institutional IT filters. Microsoft 365;s filter thinks the email looks like a phish. Please request that your IT change this setting for the sharepointonline.com domain. If this is not possible, please reach out to randy.tarnowski@aiccu.edu to figure out an alternative submission method.

<div id="update"><h3>Updates</h3></div></p>

<p><ul>
    <li>To reduce confusion, we changed language to request records based on when student would be anticipated to begin rather than when the application was received.</li>
    <li>We have also reduced collection to only those that were accepted to enroll during the fall 2019 period. The &ldquo;period&rdquo; term is meant to be reflective of those institutions who have rolling or nontraditional admission cycles. As such, Column H (ADT Flag) is there to confirm that each student submitted fits the requested criteria - ALL records should have an &ldquo;X&rdquo; in this field.</li>
